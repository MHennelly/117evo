# Evolutionary Algorithm : Real-time Cannon Simulator

### Description:

Project for CS 117, goal is to make a simulator which finds an efficient combination
of velocity and angle for launching a cannonball. Does it in real-time via a
server connection and THP so that the target can be updated without having to
reload the program.
